what_will_you_learn:
  heading: "What will you learn in this course?"
  sub_title: |
    Learning to program is also about developing logic and understanding how a computer "thinks", 
    how they "speak", how the elements of an application mesh and understand each other.

    Developing the ability to program goes hand in hand with creativity and the search for 
    solutions to problems. Programming means solving problems through certain tools with which 
    instructions are created so that situations or problems are systematically solved by software.

    In short, in this course you will learn a new way of thinking. You will develop a solid base of 
    front-end, back-end, database, distributed process management and deployment to different web 
    platforms. You will gain the skills and knowledge to create a website by immersing yourself in the 
    best practices of responsive web design, working with various languages.

  list:
    - content: "A full stack developer is a developer who has mastered Full-Stack technology, 
        both front-end and back-end. And what does all this mean? So you should know these terms:"
    - label: "Stack"
      content: |
        Stack translation is "stack of things", in this case it would be the complete 
        stack of applications that communicate with each other, so that they can execute, 
        together, an action requested by the user/client

    - label: "Front-end"
      content: "It's everything the user (or client side) can see and interact with."
    - label: "Backend"
      content: "It is the internal architecture of the site, it is everything that happens on the 
        server side. It is not visible to the user but it is the part that processes the information 
        received from the front-end."
    - content: "In this way, a full stack developer knows the entire chain of a system or application. 
        The job of these developers is to get the components of a system to communicate with each other 
        to get a program to solve the problem for which it was created.

        In a programming course in which you will become a full-stack developer, you will learn 
        about the front-end, the back-end, and what is in between, we can say that APIs are part of 
        what is in between.

        APIs are modules that make it possible for two different sets of software to communicate 
        and interact with each other.

        By becoming a full stack developer these terms will not be foreign to you and <strong>you will live 
        with them to create incredible things!</strong>"
