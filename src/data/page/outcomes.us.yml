          <li class='li-outcomes-link' > Our Placement Ratio considers only students actually looking for a job and completing the career support process at 4GA.</li>
          <li class='li-outcomes-link' > We have considered In-Person Students. Remote programs were launched due to Covid-19, and were not considered in this report because those cohorts were still open by the time this report was published.</li>

        There are a few recommendations that we make in order to speed up the process:
        <ul class='ul-outcomes'>
          <li class='li-outcomes-link' > Spend as much time as you can with our mentors, or with Developer friends, or with people who know about coding and are willing to help you out.</li>
          <li class='li-outcomes-link' > Keep practicing, there is no magical touch. If you put in the time, you will find a job.</li>
          <li class='li-outcomes-link' > Get into internships even if they don't pay you well. If you can spend at least 3
months working for someone or joining an internship, do it.</li>
          <li class='li-outcomes-link' > Your first Job is the most important part of your Application Process. Everything will
be different after you land your first Job;</li>
