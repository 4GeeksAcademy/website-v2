    text: |
      Launching a career in tech involves assessing your current situation and making informed decisions about the future.
      It requires assessment of yourself, your context, and ACTION. You can do this alone; or you can rely on a mentor's experience which can give you
      Perspective, information and access to the right resources. In 4Geeks we adjust the sessions according to your calendar,
      We also give you the opportunity to have them online or in-person.
      In any case, we assure you that you have the opportunity for constant mentoring whenever you need it.
