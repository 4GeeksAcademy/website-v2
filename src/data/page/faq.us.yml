      "In order to become the best software developer possible you will have to commit a certain number of hours, there is no other way, in our Part-Time program you will have classes 3 hours a day, 3 times a week, and you will need to dedicate about 20-24 hours to study. On the other hand, if you are taking our Full-Time program, it will be 8 hour classes each day and if you dedicate about 48 hours to study a week it will be enough."
  - question: "Why Javascript?"
    only_for: ["full-stack"]
    answer: |-
      "JavaScript "owns" the web; it is the only language that all web browsers understand, it is also the most used coding language in the world; every site need it, and it's also the most demanded language by companies at least ten times more than the rest."
  - question: "Why Python?"
    answer: |-
      "Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries.  It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields growing to be “the future”:  Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, etc.  According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn.  Go ahead and take a look for yourself <a class="faq-link" target="a_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>.
      It has to be Python.  You will find more job opportunities; you will learn to code, and it will help you with other back-end languages and frameworks.  Even Google endorsed python and has incorporated it everywhere!"
  - question: "Why not Node JS?"
    only_for: ["full-stack"]
    answer: |-
      "Node is amazing.  It challenges the way the web is created.  However, only 0.3% of the web has adopted Node JS, and its growth has slowed even further over the last months.  Python, Java, PHP, and other similar languages still rule the world (and that is not going to change anytime soon).  They work in a very different way than Node does; our purpose is to prepare you for the “real world.”  We train our Full-Stack Developers using/teaching only the most standard and professional technologies.
      <a class="faq-link" href="/us/post/dont-teach-nodejs-full-stack-development-program">Here</a> you can find a great argument as to why we are not teaching Node JS."

      Personalized Mentoring - Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.
      Mentor-student ratio 1: 6 (on average): A close and personalized environment gives our academy the opportunity to adapt to the particular pace of each student.
