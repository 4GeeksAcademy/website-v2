      - question: |
          Why "Part-time?" How does it work?
        answer: |-
          "We believe that the future of education is 'part time'. What we offer is a blended education that leverages two proven formats: part-time training and flipped classroom. The methodology has a combination of the following four pillars:
          Flipped classroom: The theory is taught through videos, animation, images, and infographics. Class time is used to discuss, create and build projects, and to be mentored to solve many practical exercises.
          Personalized Mentoring - Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.
          Mentor-student ratio 1: 6 (on average): A close and personalized environment gives our academy the opportunity to adapt to the particular pace of each student.
          Talent Tree - The curriculum charts 44 skills in which students earn points for each skill learned in a playful way."
      - question: "Why 'Full-time'? How does it work?"

  - topic: "Frequently Asked Questions about Experience"
    questions:
      - question: "Why Javascript?"
        answer: |-
          "JavaScript "owns" the web; it is the only language that all web browsers understand, it is also the most used coding language in the world; every site need it, and it's also the most demanded language by companies at least ten times more than the rest."
      - question: "Why Python?"
        answer: |
          Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries.  It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields growing to be "the future":  Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, etc.  According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn.  Go ahead and take a look for yourself <a class="faq-link" target="a_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>.
          It has to be Python.  You will find more job opportunities; you will learn to code, and it will help you with other back-end languages and frameworks.  Even Google endorsed python and has incorporated it everywhere!
      - question: "Why not Node JS?"
        answer: |
          Node is amazing.  It challenges the way the web is created.  However, only 0.3% of the web has adopted Node JS, and its growth has slowed even further over the last months.  Python, Java, PHP, and other similar languages still rule the world (and that is not going to change anytime soon).  They work in a very different way than Node does; our purpose is to prepare you for the "real world."  We train our Full-Stack Developers using/teaching only the most standard and professional technologies.
          <a class="faq-link" href="/us/trends-and-tech/dont-teach-nodejs-full-stack-development-program">Here</a> you can find a great argument as to why we are not teaching Node JS.
      - question: "Do I need to have previous experience in programming to join the bootcamp?"
        answer: |-
          "No. You just need to want to learn. Coding must exist in some part of your body and we will find it! If you already know how to open your browser and check facebook then we’ll be fine!"
      - question: "Do I graduate as a 'Senior Developer?'"
        answer: |
          No. Please, don’t run before you learn how to walk. Coding is just like life, if you are good at it you will learn faster, but you will not learn instantly.You will get the experience to see all the details once you have mastered the art. Taking our Full-Stack program means that your life will have a new skill, but you will also develop a brand new way of thinking. You will graduate as a Junior Developer bur as a REALLY GOOD "Junior Developer", not just another one in the bunch.
      - question: "What is the market like for companies seeking developers?"
        answer: |-
          "Taking into account estimations made by the IDB between 2020 and 2025 there will be a need for 10.5million professionals in the tech industry around the world. At the moment there are more than 1.4 millions job openings for programming in the US and this number is expected to increase by 2021; in Spain, during the pandemic, 1.500 job openings were created from programming in only one of the job search platforms, on the other hand in Latin America they will need around 1.2million tech professional to help reduce the gap. Therefore, the market for companies seeking to hire programmers is going to continue to grow at a rapid pace in order to keep up with the large demand."
