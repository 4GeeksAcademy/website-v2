          Yes, having your own laptop is essential for our classes. While we don't mandate a specific operating system for most programs, it's recommended to have a laptop with Windows, macOS, or Linux installed.<br>
          However, for the <a class="faq-link" href="https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/cybersecurity">cybersecurity program</a>, it's highly recommended to have a laptop with either Windows or Linux operating system due to the nature of the course materials and tools used. For example, applications like VirtualBox and Packet Tracer will be used, so please consider the technical requirements for these tools. Packet Tracer is available for Linux and Windows, while VirtualBox is only compatible with Mac for Intel processors. Additionally, for virtual machines, it's recommended to have at least 4 processor threads and 8 GB of RAM to ensure optimal performance.<br>
          The classes and exercises for all programs are accessed through the cloud.

          At 4Geeks Academy, we offer payment options such as Income Share Agreements (ISA) or Deferred Tuition plans, allowing you to pay after securing employment. <br>
          These models are designed to support your learning journey, enabling you to focus on education before repaying once you're employed. However, terms and conditions vary based on your chosen program and location.<br>

      #     Yes! With our Income Share Agreement (ISA), you'll only pay $1,000 upfront for the bootcamp. The remaining tuition is paid only after you secure a job earning more than $35k per year. If you're not hired, you won't pay anything. Plus, if you lose your job for any reason, your payments will be paused until you're employed again.

        answer: |-
          Yes! We offer an Income Share Agreement (ISA) program as an innovative financing option for our students. With an ISA, you can commence your studies immediately and begin making payments once you secure a well-paying job. Unlike traditional loans, payment under an ISA is based on a percentage of your income once you exceed a set minimum wage.

        answer: |-
            We believe that the future of education is "part-time." Our approach is a blended education that leverages two proven formats: part-time training and flipped classroom. This methodology combines the following four pillars:<br><br>
            <strong>Flipped Classroom:</strong> The theory is taught through videos, animation, images, and infographics. Class time is used to discuss, create and build projects, and to be mentored in solving practical exercises.<br><br>
            <strong>Personalized Mentoring:</strong> Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.<br><br>
            <strong>Mentor-Student Ratio 1:6 (on average):</strong> A close and personalized environment allows our academy to adapt to the particular pace of each student.<br><br>
            <strong>Talent Tree:</strong> The curriculum charts 44 skills in which students earn points for each skill learned in a playful way.<br><br>

      - question: "Why JavaScript?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |-
          JavaScript "owns" the web; it is the only language that all web browsers understand. It is also the most used coding language in the world. Every site needs it, and it's the most demanded language by companies, at least ten times more than the rest.

      - question: "Why Python?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries. It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields, growing to be "the future" in areas like Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, and more. According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn. Go ahead and take a look for yourself <a class="faq-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>. Python is the way to go. It offers more job opportunities, helps you learn to code, and supports you with other back-end languages and frameworks. Even Google endorses Python and has incorporated it everywhere!

      - question: "Why not Node JS?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          Node.js is indeed an impressive technology, challenging the traditional approach to web development. However, only a small fraction, about 0.3%, of the web has adopted Node.js, and its growth rate has slowed in recent months. Meanwhile, languages like Python, Java, and PHP continue to dominate the industry and are unlikely to change anytime soon. These languages operate differently from Node.js, and our goal is to prepare you for the 'real world' by teaching the most standard and professional technologies. You can find a detailed argument explaining our decision not to teach Node.js in our Full-Stack Development Program <a class="faq-link" href="/us/trends-and-tech/dont-teach-nodejs-full-stack-development-program">here</a>.

      - question: "Do I graduate as a 'Senior Developer?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          No, graduating from any Bootcamp does not automatically make you a 'Senior'. The title of 'Senior' typically comes with years of experience in the field. However, our bootcamp is designed to equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to start your career as a 'Junior Developer' and with the dedication and continuous learning, you can work your way up to a senior position.
