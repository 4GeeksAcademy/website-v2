Classes and exercises for all programs are accessed via the cloud.

        answer: |-
          At 4Geeks Academy, we offer payment options such as Income Share Agreements (ISA) or Deferred Tuition plans, allowing you to pay after securing employment. <br>
          These models are designed to support your learning journey, enabling you to focus on education before repaying once you're employed. However, terms and conditions vary based on your chosen program and location.<br>
          For further details and eligibility criteria, please discuss these options with our <a class="faq-link" href="mailto:admission@4geeksacademy.com">admissions team</a>.

        answer: |-
          Yes! With our Income Share Agreement (ISA), you'll only pay $1,000 upfront for the bootcamp. The remaining tuition is paid only after you secure a job earning more than $35k per year. If you're not hired, you won't pay anything. Plus, if you lose your job for any reason, your payments will be paused until you're employed again.

        answer: |-
          Yes! We offer an Income Share Agreement (ISA) program as an innovative financing option for our students. With an ISA, you can commence your studies immediately and begin making payments once you secure a well-paying job. Unlike traditional loans, payment under an ISA is based on a percentage of your income once you exceed a set minimum wage.

        answer: |-
          "We believe that the future of education is 'part time'. What we offer is a blended education that leverages two proven formats: part-time training and flipped classroom. The methodology has a combination of the following four pillars:
          Flipped classroom: The theory is taught through videos, animation, images, and infographics. Class time is used to discuss, create and build projects, and to be mentored to solve many practical exercises.
          Personalized Mentoring - Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.
          Mentor-student ratio 1: 6 (on average): A close and personalized environment gives our academy the opportunity to adapt to the particular pace of each student.
          Talent Tree - The curriculum charts 44 skills in which students earn points for each skill learned in a playful way.

        priority: 0
        answer: |-
          JavaScript "owns" the web; it is the only language that all web browsers understand, it is also the most used coding language in the world; every site need it, and it's also the most demanded language by companies at least ten times more than the rest.
      - question: "Why Python?"

        answer: |
          Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries.  It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields growing to be "the future":  Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, etc.  According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn.  Go ahead and take a look for yourself <a class="faq-link" target="a_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>.
          It has to be Python.  You will find more job opportunities; you will learn to code, and it will help you with other back-end languages and frameworks.  Even Google endorsed python and has incorporated it everywhere!
      - question: "Why not Node JS?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          Node.js is indeed an impressive technology, challenging the traditional approach to web development. However, only a small fraction, about 0.3%, of the web has adopted Node.js, and its growth rate has slowed in recent months. Meanwhile, languages like Python, Java, and PHP continue to dominate the industry and are unlikely to change anytime soon. These languages operate differently from Node.js, and our goal is to prepare you for the 'real world' by teaching the most standard and professional technologies. You can find a detailed argument explaining our decision not to teach Node.js in our Full-Stack Development Program <a class="faq-link" href="/us/trends-and-tech/dont-teach-nodejs-full-stack-development-program">here</a>.
      - question: "Do I need to have previous experience in programming to join the bootcamp?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |-
          No. You just need to want to learn. Coding must exist in some part of your body and we will find it! If you already know how to open your browser and check facebook then we'll be fine!
      - question: "Do I graduate as a 'Senior Developer?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          No, graduating from any Bootcamp does not automatically make you a 'Senior'. The title of 'Senior' typically comes with years of experience in the field. However, our bootcamp is designed to equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to start your career as a 'Junior Developer' and with the dedication and continuous learning, you can work your way up to a senior position.

          Taking into account estimations made by the IDB between 2020 and 2025 there will be a need for 10.5million professionals in the tech industry around the world. At the moment there are more than 1.4 millions job openings for programming in the US and this number is expected to increase by 2021; in Spain, during the pandemic, 1.500 job openings were created from programming in only one of the job search platforms, on the other hand in Latin America they will need around 1.2million tech professional to help reduce the gap. Therefore, the market for companies seeking to hire programmers is going to continue to grow at a rapid pace in order to keep up with the large demand.
