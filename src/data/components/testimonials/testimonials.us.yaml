      tutors who will make sure you master your skills and will not give up on you if there's 
      something you don't understand. They never leave my questions unanswered, regardless
      of how obvious they may seem..and the atmosphere in the school is very warm. I'm 
      grateful to you guys for providing 24 hour access to school, so we can work any time that
      is convenient for us. Thank you, 4Geeks!!!

      completing the Bootcamp.

      I highly recommend this coding boot camp!!!! Before 4Geeks I never had any experience with 
      code - I didn't know where to start. Within 10 weeks I was able to grasp the core concepts 
      of being a developer. The staff and Mentors are awesome... enroll today if yoou want to go from 
      zero to hero in 10 weeks and start developing your own apps.

      This program was definitely one of the hardest things I've done in my life. It was 16 weeks of 
      constant work and practice. All things in life worth having is not going to be easily obtained. 
      If you can stick with it and follow what the teachers are teaching you, you will succeed.

      I was a lawyer for 6 years and I decided to change my career. I attended 4Geeks Academy, a coding bootcamp, that was last year (2018), I graduated in August, and after graduating in October, I was able to get a job as a web developer. I had no background whatsoever in coding. I didn't know anything about anything computer-technology wise, so that's an encouragement because it's possible!

      At first I had many doubts and wondered if I could do it, and I did. Once I entered 4Geeks and the weeks and projects went by, I realized that my skills were increasing. At 4Geeks they teach you how to program, how to solve problems, you learn logical thinking, new languages, etc.
      I encourage you to enter the world of programming with 4Geeks Academy.

      Before 4Geeks, I worked in law enforcement; after that, I wasn't very motivated by the idea of law enforcement.
      But when I came to live in San Francisco, I learned about technology and the benefits that come with working in this field.
      and this is what brought me to 4Geeks. Now I am working for a company called NCCI, which is located in Boca, and it is amazing.
      I couldn't have made a better decision by choosing to code.

      My experience in 4Geeks Academy was and is the best. The instructors and TAs will help you in 
      a blink. 4Geeks' Slack should be renamed to 4Geeks Overflow. The response time is fast. The 
      responses are strong and different solutions are provided. If you have an interview and you 
      want to refresh your knowledge or exercise do not hesitate to go to 4Geeks, you will find 
      someone ready to help you.
