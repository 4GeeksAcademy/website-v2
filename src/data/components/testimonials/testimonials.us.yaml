      I felt lost in my career and could not see clear goals for myself anymore.  I came across 
      this great opportunity to join this community of knowledge and, to top it all off, great humans!
      I found myself able to commit to something very interesting with endless options 
      to create my career as a graphic designer more powerful without having to stop what I was doing 
      within a perfect part-time cohort. 
      I now have all kinds of new tools I learned there along the way, 
      and there is a new comfort in knowing that I can always go back and keep growing at 4Geeks.

      I love 4Geeks Academy's approach to teaching students. There are always at least three tutors who will 
      make sure you master your skills and will not give up on you if there's something 
      you don't understand. They never leave my questions unanswered, regardless of how obvious 
      they may seem..and the atmosphere in the school is very warm.
      I'm grateful to you guys for providing 24 hour access to school, 
      so we can work any time that is convenient for us. Thank you, 4Geeks!!!

  #     I've been learning how to code by myself for 4 years, mostly HTML, CSS and PHP.
  #     I've been struggling a lot trying to make a dynamic website, so I started to look
  #     for a coding school in Miami and I found the best one: 4Geeks Academy. And thanks to
  #     the Income Sharing Agreement, I could enroll right away and pay once I found a job.

      Overall just a great group of people with a common goal. I came into 4Geeks with little 
      to no knowledge about coding and after 16 weeks I was building projects I could have never 
      imagined I would be able to build. They will provide you with the knowledge and tools to 
      become a successful developer ready for hire.... Ask as many questions 
      as you need and they will be happy to help. Not to mention the lifetime support you get 
      even after completing the Bootcamp.

      I highly recommend this coding boot camp!!!! Before 4Geeks I never had any experience with 
      code - I didn't know where to start. Within 10 weeks I was able to grasp the core concepts 
      of being a developer. The staff and Mentors are awesome... enroll today if yoou want to go from 
      zero to hero in 10 weeks and start developing your own apps.

      This program was definitely one of the hardest things I've done in my life. It was 16 weeks of 
      constant work and practice. All things in life worth having is not going to be easily obtained. 
      If you can stick with it and follow what the teachers are teaching you, you will succeed.

      Now I think that I can actually know how to solve the issues that I face when Iâ€™m coding and 
      the professors have been a great help along the process. I would recommend this Bootcamp to 
      everyone.

      My experience in 4Geeks Academy was and is the best. The instructors and TAs will help you in 
      a blink. 4Geeks' Slack should be renamed to 4Geeks Overflow. The response time is fast. The 
      responses are strong and different solutions are provided. If you have an interview and you 
      want to refresh your knowledge or exercise do not hesitate to go to 4Geeks, you will find 
      someone ready to help you.

      I was a lawyer for 6 years and I decided to change my career. I attended 4Geeks Academy, a coding bootcamp, that was last year (2018), I graduated in August, and after graduating in October, I was able to get a job as a web developer. I had no background whatsoever in coding. I didnâ€™t know anything about anything computer-technology wise, so thatâ€™s an encouragement because itâ€™s possible!
