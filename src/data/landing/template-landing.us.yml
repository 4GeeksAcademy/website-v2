  - name: Guensie Grecy
    sub_heading: From lawyer to software developer
    comment: I was a lawyer for 6 years and I decided to change my career. I attended 4Geeks Academy, a coding bootcamp, that was last year (2018), I graduated in August, and after graduating in October, I was able to get a job as a web developer. I had no background whatsoever in coding. I didn't know anything about anything computer-technology wise, so that's an encouragement because it's possible!

    comment: For me the most amazing thing about 4Geeks was the syllabus, the fact that you guys teach exactly what the market is looking for.
