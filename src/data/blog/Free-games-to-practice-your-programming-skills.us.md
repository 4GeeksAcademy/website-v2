# Free games to practice your coding skills

![coding-games.jpg](../../../static/images/blog/coding-games.jpg)

How do you stay motivated while learning to code? 🤔

As much as we'd like our coding journey to be all uphill↗️, sometimes it can be a bit of a roller coaster🎢. But luckily, we have a few insights from experience to keep you motivated. 

Two important things to keep in mind while learning to code are to practice and persevere. However, people often associate studying with long hours of reading, learning, and performing technical tasks in front of a screen. Of course, this is all part of it, but after some time it can become dull and our brain disconnects. At this point, we stop making sense of it, get frustrated, and stop.😳 Do you relate to this? Well, fear no more! Our Coding Bootcamp is all about pushing you forward and practicing really cool stuff to keep you motivated. 😎

The best way to make your coding knowledge stick is to practice (a lot). A fun way to practice your skills every day is by playing coding games. These games aim to achieve a specific goal while using a specific programming language, such as Python, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, and more. 

Want to know more? Here is our top 5 games you can play to practice your programming skills ⬇️

1) [**CSS Diner:](https://flukeout.github.io/)** this is a game where you are learning and practicing how to use different CSS selectors. It has 32 different levels- one for almost every selector. The goal is to figure out how to select the items that are on the table. For example, in the image below you can see two white plates on the table, so you have to properly select them.

3) [**Elevator Saga:](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/)** As the name implies, Elevator Saga is about programming elevators and it works using JavaScript. This game gives you different challenges and your job is to program an elevator to transport people. In order to pass each challenge, you have to transport a certain amount of passengers in a certain amount of time. The game will see how efficient and fast you are at transporting people by creating scripts with JavaScript. One of the main advantages of this game is that you can see your script performing in real-time, so if there is something wrong with your code you can troubleshoot it quickly and keep on.
