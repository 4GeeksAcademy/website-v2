Education has always been a matter of “How to Pay?”, “Do I qualify?”, “Am I going to be accepted?”, and then, again, “How do I Pay that tuition?”

First things first, let’s answer your main question right away: How much does the program cost?

Part-time
### $7,499

Full-time
### $9,499


### No extra fees. No tricks.


There are, normally, three ways to face that challenge: (i) Scholarships (any kind); (ii) Banking (or financial institutions) support; and, (iii) Paying your own fees (self-funded).

However, we have designed a customized financial payment option just for this program.

We lowered the cost, and, yes, it was a big challenge, but we found a way to offer you a Premium Education with an unbeatable price.

[Apply to our program and get the chance to pay your education from only $240 per month](/us/apply)

Now there’s more: We do not only offer the best price in the city but also the best payment plan.  Others will follow, but we know _**we are the first**_ to offer you the Extended Payment Plan.

If you want to fully understand how the process works and what we mean by “Extended Payment Plan”, you can take a deeper look in our [Payment GuideBook](https://storage.googleapis.com/4geeks-academy-website/Material%20(PDF%20and%20Images)%20website/4GA%20Financial%20Guidebook.pdf)x We tried to answer every question you may have, but, most importantly, we have designed a program where coding is a priority and not pricing.

****Upfront Payment**: You can either pay in (1) one down payment; or, (2) split the upfront amount into thirds.  If you choose “Pay in thirds”, the first 1/3 is due 15 days before the start date.  The next 1/3 is due the very same day of the start date, and last 1/3 is due 15 days after start date.
