Since we started 4Geeks, I have always been in charge of admissions in the US and elsewhere. I have interviewed or met -at least - more than 3400 people right in the moment where they are about to decide whether joining a coding bootcamp is the right choice for learning to code. 

But the decision is not about whether joining 4Geeks or not. Not even, although it happens occasionally, about the Bootcamp industry itself. Normally someone that comes to an interview at 4Geeks is already aware that this is a great option. We are reliable, trustful and dedicated. We also have built a sense of family and care about each other. The decision is about the bigger question. Should I really learn to code? Am I going to learn? Am I good enough for this? Am I actually getting a job afterwards?

That pretty much shows my data in terms of admissions. Just me, not the company as a whole. I have dealt directly with over 30k applicants, from which I have interviewed at least +3k, and enrolled over a 1000 already. 

Every story is different and I must say that there are many different cultures, backgrounds, reasons, nationalities involved. However, I have found similarities that it might be helpful to share, some of them, because I just realized that maybe it could help to clear your mind from preconceived thoughts. 
Zero-Coding background

One of the common grounds when interviewing a candidate to join one of our cohorts is that they are coming -most of them- from a background that has nothing to do with coding. No experience, almost no practice and no background. Let’s say that the majority of applicants/potential students have that common ground: lack of experience in coding. 

Then the main struggle is facing the question of whether they could -or not- become a successful developer (landing a job after the program). For me it’s clear. For someone who has been there it’s clear, but for someone that is just realizing that, is not clear at all. And my answer it’s always the same: everyone can learn to code; although not everyone would work as a software developer.
Learning to code it’s a matter of logic. It’s not a matter of syntaxis. Entering the world of coding means that you are opening your career to a world full of new challenges. But it doesn’t necessarily mean that you will become, eventually, a senior software developer. There are many paths that you can take, and there are many positions, professions, opportunities requiring you to think as a developer even if you are not acting as the person in charge of writing down the code of a particular app. 

Switching careers

People joining a Coding Bootcampo normally have a previous on-going career. The decision behind opening up their growth to a new career normally means that they are tired of doing the same over and over, or it’s just that they don’t like their current job, or it’s not well paid, or maybe they were laid off, or there are not so many opportunities out there, or they actually need this to keep growing within the company.

Many reasons, right? Maybe if you are reading this post you might see something familiar; or maybe you bring a new one. But that’s not the point. What’s important is that we are normally afraid of changing our stuff. Change is a hard word when we talk about us. Dealing with a professional change it's even harder. It’s about realizing that you need, want and are ready for more. 

I have seen how a vast majority of those students that have finally decided to join 4Geeks are doing the program because they want to change careers. And I have seen nobody regretting that decision. That’s more than 600 people. Those are developers with an on-going career in tech that were not afraid of making the jump forward. Coding is, finally, the way to jump several steps forward in your career.  
How to start

I’ve seen how many people come with the right questions but I’be also seenthose who are coming just to explore or validate something that is not really for them. First, we need to really think about what Coding represents in your life? Do you see it as a hobby, as a solution for your income, as a potential strength (when you get the appropriate training)? Have you started to practice before meeting with a Coding Bootcamp? 

If you just read the stories and see how people actually make a good living out of coding, but you don't really understand what's behind, then probably you should take a step back and rethink your motives and reasons. When I have an interview with a potential student of 4Geeks, I always start saying: what’s your reason to be here today with me?

Therefore, I would say that the best way for you to know if coding is for you, remains strictly on you. And I don’t mean you and your hard skills, but more in your soft skills: why do you want to learn to code and how much are you willing to give? 

Then, going to crash courses and online tutorials seem like a good option. Code Academy, Udemy, Youtube tutorials. Then, you should go and get access to a Pre-work curse, for free, from a Coding Bootcamop. Try this one, it’s great. 
How do you know if Coding it’s for you?

Our folks at Career Karma have shared a simple graphic highlighting the advantage of joining coding Bootcamops and how do we work. Click here for the full story.



If you are in your twenties or thirties, if you are thinking about getting a better job or a better income, working from home or in a tech centric environment, and if you know you are passionate about building stuff, being creative and capable of sitting down 12 hours in a row in a front of a computer just because there is a coma missing, then probably this is for you. 

But also, if you are thinking about launching a tech startup or if you hold a position where every day more coding tasks are required, then joining a Bootcamp is also your best option. 

Recently we have also seen more and more computer science students and graduates asking for info and joining our Bootcamp because they know and they need the hard skills provided at a school like 4Geeks.
