# **The Growth Road**




**Working Full-Time During a Part-Time Bootcamp**


You want to learn to code. You are ready to make the decision. Deadlines are approaching. Your full-time job is still there. A part-time Bootcamp may be the perfect solution.

Committing to a part-time intensive program requires you to maintain a huge drive. You need to keep the momentum going to succeed. We understand that your time is precious, and we have come up with a program that aims to empower you with the skills required for a successful coding career, on top of your existing work commitments, in a realistic and achievable timeframe. 

We’ll be honest - we don’t promise that our Bootcamps are easy. What we will say, however, is that through hard work and a practical learning approach, 90% of our graduates are now working as software developers, with an average entry salary of $45,000. In contrast, industry-wide hiring rates for Bootcamp graduates [averaged 79% in 2018](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2018).

**Time management**

During a part-time coding Bootcamp, you’ll be completely immersed in the content you’re learning, while you’re learning it - but don’t forget to take time to step away from this and reflect on what you’ve covered. You’ll be absorbing the information much more effectively when your mind is able to take a break between sessions. 

To help with this, one piece of advice given by a previous Bootcamp student, Kevin, is to set aside one day a week to take a break from coding. “For me it was Sunday, I would stay away from the computer and reserved the day for family/personal time.” Scott, another student suggests coding in the mornings before work - this will free up your evenings after work, and help you to maintain a life outside of work and study.

The ability to prioritize and plan will be more important than ever before. The advice given by a previous student, named Colby, is to make sure you create a schedule and stick to it. “You need to make time to make your homework, to practice and to work, because doing everything without an order, it's impossible.”

**Practical learning**

An important advantage of our part-time Bootcamp is that we focus on practicing the skills you’re learning. Unlike a traditional tertiary education format, which tends to focus on knowledge because skills, we use the 22-hour weekly time commitment to arm you with real, useful skills that you’ll be able to put into practice in the workplace as soon as you graduate. We’re not afraid to [flip tradition on its head](/us/learn-to-code/turnaround-education-traditions-4geeks-academy), in order to keep up with the evolving needs of our students.

**Lifelong support**

Most importantly, you can be sure that you’ll feel fully supported throughout your Bootcamp journey and beyond, with our Lifetime Career Support program. This program has four fundamental goals: to help students become an ideal market fit, to help you build a strong portfolio full of projects, to improve your chances of getting a new job, and to discover new job openings with our partners.

Naila, one of our students, explains this: “I love 4Geeks Academy's approach to teaching students. There are always 3 tutors who will make sure you master your skills and will not give up on you if there's something you don't understand. They never leave my questions unanswered, regardless of how obvious they may seem.” 

Previous students agree that taking on a part-time Bootcamp is difficult, but worth it if you’re willing to put in the work. “It's hard as hell, and the burn-out is super easy… If the majority of your day is taken up by your day job then you're going to need to make major sacrifices. It's just the nature of the beast, but a necessary step if you're looking to change careers.”

The nature of coding, like any area of technology, is that it’s constantly changing, and by adapting your daily life to include the additional responsibility of part-time study, you’ll prepare yourself for the need to be constantly on the ball and ready for any changes that come up. For this reason, we are constantly working to maintain an up-to-date [syllabus that fits in with our students’ expectations](/us/coding-bootcamps/coding-bootcamp-syllabus-matters).

**Real results**

Of course, by doing all of this, you’ll be looking for a result - that by the end you’ll be [employable as a web developer](/us/career-growth/7-hacks-to-land-a-job). Not only will you become a [Full-Stack Software Developer](/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer), but you’ll also have a competitive advantage through being self-driven enough to have achieved this qualification in an intensive part-time format, on top of your existing commitments.

You’ll have had no choice but to maintain the momentum you built when you first committed to a Bootcamp, and over the course of the program, this fire that you’ve been burning will have ignited a passion in you that employers will go to great lengths to seek out.
