Have you ever played Sims, League Of Legends, Zelda or Civilization?  If you have, you are very familiar with the concept of “earning skills.”  The** Talent Tree ®** is one of the things that makes us very proud – it is the foundation on which the entire academic experience is built on.  Here is why:


### **Knowing is not as relevant anymore**


Throughout the years, the teaching methodologies have had a big focus towards “knowing.” Knowing enables humans - making them more valuable and productive.  Basically, the more you know = the better you are.  That is why “Direct Instruction” has become the main teaching method in most universities these days.


### **Skills over knowledge**


When it comes to coding, technologies are evolving so fast that is impossible to become a master (know it all).  Probably, by the time you think you are an expert, the technology has already pivoted into a better approach (framework, library, etc.).

_For example: 16 months ago, ReactJS was an experimental library and today it’s the most used technology to create front-end interfaces.  That is why “knowing” ReactJS is not as appreciated as being able (skill) to learn ReactJS by yourself.  Companies test candidate skills, not their knowledge._

That is why we decided to base all of our syllabus, methodology, content, experience and online platform on only one premise:  **Making the student develop the required skills for a developer to succeed in the real world.**


## **The Talent Tree**

When you start learning in 4Geeks Academy, you are presented with a map with all the skills required to become a real developer.  Having clean organized code, doing research, and problem-solving are only some of the 10 skills that you will need to master in order to become a real-life developer.


### **Gamification**


You officially have a skill when you earn all of its badges by completing challenges, quizzes, projects, exercises and other stuff.  The more badges you have, the closer you are to becoming a real developer.


### **Self-assessment**


Another thing we love about The** Talent Tree ®** is its capacity to empower the student, making them self-aware of their real-time progress throughout the course.

### Constant Evolution


Finally, we would like to point out that The Talent Tree is as alive as any other tree on earth :).  We are constantly polishing the skills, our content, and the online platform to make everything as fun and effective as possible!
