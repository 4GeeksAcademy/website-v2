At 4Geeks we take very seriously the whole deal about how to become a software developer.  There are plenty of options, I know, and there are plenty of opinions, I know. But we have found a lack of argument when talking about the schedule and the methodology brought by the coding program.

Having a coding program that is either part-time or full time, or even online, is not an easy discussion.  The whole product is built around that decision.  It is not – at least it should not be - a marketing approach, but a career approach.   We do not choose Part-time because we know most people have work/things to do; we choose Part-time because we are sure that we are able to build software developers out of our students if we took care of the methodology.

We believe in part-time education, but only if the methodology and the product are designed towards enabling students to become developers without taking their life away for 4-6 months.  Some people say that if you want to become a professional developer, your only choice is a Full-time program [1].  Sorry, but that’s not true.

If you are likely to spend your time (every day for several weeks) in a Coding Bootcamp, we are delighted with that decision.  You should do it.  But please, stop saying that the only way to become a software developer (or a web developer at least) is by taking a full-time program.  It’s like saying that Thinkful has been wrong with their online program.  You don’t become a chef just because you eat all day, but, because you cook every day: at 4Geeks you have to write code every day.

The program schedule makes the difference.  Of course, Part-time could not imply only 100 hours of practice.  If so, you are not becoming a developer.  But Part-time, at least in our case, does not refer to that.  Taking a program with a blended education, focusing on a flipped around classroom, with a Mentor/student ratio of 1:7, and based on a Mastery learning process, will enable you to achieve the skills you need to get a job in Tech or to launch your startup.  And that is a Part-time program - [our program](/the-program/).

In order to become a developer, you need to commit to - at least - 300 hours of hard work. And, as previously stated, a part-time program does not equate to delivering less or poor content (you are still committing to more than 300 hours of work).  It actually requires a strong product, a well-designed methodology, and the support of technology (Build your own academic platform -LMS-) to achieve the quality expected from the student.

While I write this post, I realize that the conversation shall not be addressed as Part-time vs. Full time programs (Online programs by the way, could be either part-time or full-time as well).  The conversation needs to stop there.  Students should start to ask: Do you need me all day every day?  Or can I actually have a life and also become a developer?  Only after you answer that question, you can choose if you want to have an online program or an in-person program.
