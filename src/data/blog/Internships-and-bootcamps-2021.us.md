Covid-19 is considered the biggest crisis of our era, impacting millions of companies around the world, cracking the social system as we know it and disrupting every sector of the global economy. Work automation and global recession are the primary outcomes of the 2020 breakout pandemic, leaving millions of people without jobs and companies facing challenges to reinvent their products and workforce. 

About 85 million jobs worldwide will be displaced and 97 million new roles will be adapted to new skill-sets in the next 5 years according to the [World Economic Forum future jobs 2020 report.](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf)

"By 2025 companies expect 1 in 2 workers will need reskilling, and those remaining in their current roles will need to update 40% of their skill-set to adapt to the changing labor market." World Economic Forum 

The technology industry has been on the frontline of this scenario, facing many challenges, adapting to disruptive trends and growing at a speed level rarely seen before, some might call this crisis the beginning of "the fourth industrial revolution" according to [Pluralsight reports](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/career/tech-in-2025?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=1621f5c1ee99d500b0e38142beab4208fdc08623-1617048574-0-Aa3vzWjD1_S3izHRbmeZFk60rJUDGgAx7cM5rjhxDIRHTDKyG9FEBG8yWEH4p75HvtNnTubadscWWd4l8vVcKRwoHh-v97AQi9Zj9f0kxYUJBEcSalb2x90Z-wWVsVzTNtahnaqe8fMloYYe19v9mI3b-1d0xkMsWIfWk5UxWMn7G-Hj_aQA4DzDuI2pxFNL2E5YSurVUFCf_xPAV8ZaXCw9ExBuAx1ckZJSmEfCySrv4tCp-8qyhIffP3djifTjHUds7gVToKy5OkRVuFtwiej3CZZdWnz9MDSpgm2LgVaal31nq_cyuI85LUOWV1JxLRtjhaadWIcNWONMhPuURIjI5zIC_disp1Rbsavjh54V8oR_uuH069uG39uCHzPaUnyO4AIq33hToxm1q8CcZaZLbp-EEbAd-sVJafUMSkpvHTGR7bumsnZ7i7dj891_trcZsVclAAyxmdDjr3Z1UxFZs72VrY-APknfeB-WtjKqypRNzFIQD3Yw9fSJcQBDiehVmbwT0L9uXZIVoi_r6KnbioKr6-FfNTRNKVCVWKTtd3XXjMk_pr3WlUg1-DxEzSdprTQLQuY2SlZ7bw6j0xY).

So in the midst of these challenges, how will companies transition? Focusing on developing their talents through learning programs. 

Some advices from [McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/how-we-help-clients) and our team analysis suggest the following scenarios and opportunities: 


Scenarios 
Opportunities 
Exponential and high speed growth in tech industries
