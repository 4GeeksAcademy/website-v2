      bio: | 
        I have been passionate about science, mathematics, and teaching my friends since I was a child.

        As I grew up, I studied Biology and later completed a fullstack programming bootcamp. Programming came easily to me due to my love for numbers and logic, and gradually, I learned many more technologies.

        Today, I focus on developing applications with Generative Artificial Intelligence, teaching, making YouTube videos, and I have many ideas to show the magic of computing. With dedication and effort, we can bring all our ideas to life.
        
        My name is Charly, and if you are passionate about the world of technology, and specifically Artificial Intelligence, get ready, because this technology is here to stay. My goal is to teach you everything I know about it, from a technical, theoretical, and practical standpoint. Are you ready?
