    - module_name: "Python"
      title: "Introduction to Python"
      description: >
        Starting from a Prework (2 weeks before), get introduced into the world of coding and learn Python and Algorithms' basics; This module will help you prepare to code and develop the different A.I. and Machine Learning model training and evaluations for the next step.
      projects: "Collect, store and mesassure with Numpy, Pandas, Mstplotlib, etc."
      slug: "python-intro"
      duration: "2 wks"
      step: 2
    - module_name: "Fundamentals"
      title: "Statistics and Linear Algebra with Python"
      description: "Use python to write code that reviews and applies the most used Linear Algebra concepts, Matrix and Vectors, F(x), and the relation functions have between variables. We will also be coding the most used concepts in probabilities understanding core trends, standard deviation, mean median and mode. Finally, we will calculate the probability of an event happening: This is a very important skill used to build prediction models that we will be using further along."
      projects: "We will provide you with a list of real life problems and solutions for the different concepts, you will use python to solve them."
      slug: "datascience-fundamentals"
      duration: "2 wks"
      step: 2
    - module_name: "Collect"
      title: "Collect and store data"
      description: "Probably longest step in most professional projects is collecting and cleaning the data. In this module you use Python and connect to a SQL Database, learn the SQL syntax to query and manipulate that date, upload and download static files (CSV, JSON, etc.). Learn how to connect with API's or scrape websites that don't have available API's. Store the data in an organized way."
      projects: "Loading structured and unstructured data from different sources (e.g. SQL, Web Scraping, text files) and connect with the Twitter API."

      title: "Choose a problem and fix it with Machine Learning"
      description: "Work in a team to choose a real life problem, start collecting the data needed to predict, make an exploratory analysis using several ways of visualizing data in order to understand it. Clean your dataset and optimized for your prediction needs, choose two models and start predicting. Evaluate how effective your models were by using the different techniques we saw in class. Deploy in production using Streamlit o Looker (Google DataStudio)."
