      title: "Data Science for AI"
      description: >
        We don’t simply train you in Data Science, we prepare you for Data Science in the Age of AI. Leveraging Python, we take you through Data Analysis & Visualizations, Database Management & Workflow, Applied Linear Algebra with Statistical Inference and Modeling. You’ll end this module by delivering a complete project where you need to apply data cleaning, data analysis, and prediction models on real-world datasets.

    - module_name: "Machine L."
      title: "Practical Machine Learning"
      description: "On a nearly weekly basis, you will be taking a deep dive into all the major subjects of Machine Learning. We start you with Machine Learning with Python, then take you through Supervised Learning, Training & Evaluation of ML Models, Unsupervised Learning, in addition to Ensemble Learning. To wrap up the module, you’ll be developing an end-to-end project that compares different Machine Learning models on a real-world dataset"
      projects: "You will solve several real life optimization algorithm challenges"
