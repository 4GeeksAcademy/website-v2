      title: "Introduction to Python"
      description: >
        Starting from a Prework (2 weeks before), get introduced into the world of coding and learn Python and Algorithms' basics; This module will help you prepare to code and develop the different A.I. and Machine Learning model training and evaluations for the next step.
      projects: "Collect, store and mesassure with Numpy, Pandas, Mstplotlib, etc."
      slug: "python-intro"
      duration: "2 wks"

    - module_name: "Data"
      title: "Data Science for AI"
      description: "We don’t simply train you in Data Science, we prepare you for Data Science in the Age of AI. Leveraging Python, we take you through Data Analysis & Visualizations, Database Management & Workflow, Applied Linear Algebra with Statistical Inference and Modeling. You’ll end this module by delivering a complete project where you need to apply data cleaning, data analysis, and prediction models on real-world datasets."
      projects: "Loading structured and unstructured data from different sources (e.g. SQL, Web Scraping, text files), exploring data, cleaning data, transforming data, visualizing data, analyzing and extracting insights, and inferential and test statistics."

    - module_name: "Machine L."
      title: "Practical Machine Learning"
      description: "On a nearly weekly basis, you will be taking a deep dive into all the major subjects of Machine Learning. We start you with Machine Learning with Python, then take you through Supervised Learning, Training & Evaluation of ML Models, Unsupervised Learning, in addition to Ensemble Learning. To wrap up the module, you’ll be developing an end-to-end project that compares different Machine Learning models on a real-world dataset"
      projects: "Selecting a problem that can be solved with ML, defining the ML type (regression, classification, or unsupervised learning), load data, pre-process data (handling missing data, encoding categorical features), create pipelines, splitting data for test and training, train multiple models, dealing with overfitting issue, compare models and select the best model using cross-validation, analyzing the results."
